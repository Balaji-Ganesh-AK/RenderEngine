Hey guys, the start-up with which I am currently working (the name of the start-up is Concurrents), we are developing a plugin/software for games, are currently in stealth mode, so I can't talk much about the software, but trust me it's amazing and we are backed by many big names, and we are also making a platform.  So we are currently looking for games to test our software, we need games that are made in UE4 and have many high poly and high-resolution textures. And I thought our game would be a perfect fit. I showed the game to my CEO and CTO and they loved it. 
So I wanna know if you guys would be fine if I use the game contents for testing our software and eventually we will make a demo with it to prompt our platform, this would be good for promoting our game as well. 
Please let me know what you guys think about it.
